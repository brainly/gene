# Production Tests Guide

## Why We Need Production Tests

Production testing ensures that our application functions correctly in the live environment, catching issues that might not appear in staging due to differences in data, configurations, or third-party integrations. Key reasons include:

- Validating critical user flows in the real-world environment.
- Ensuring new releases do not break existing functionality.
- Detecting edge cases and anomalies specific to production data or configuration.

## Responsibilities

Production E2E testing is a collaborative effort between developers and QA engineers.

**Creation:**

- **Developer or QA**:
  - Creates tests when working on specific increments, with responsibility assigned based on team and project leader decisions.
  - Ensures flaky tests are promptly addressed and fixed.

**Fixing:** The developer who introduced the bug.

**Maintenance:** Developers responsible for changes in the relevant area of production E2E tests.

**Observability:** Developers ensure the codebase supports production testing, including adequate logging and monitoring.

## Scope and Effort

- **E2E Smoke Tests**: Quick checks on critical user flows to confirm basic functionality.
- **Manual Exploratory Tests**: Ad-hoc testing to uncover edge cases and unexpected behaviors not covered by automated tests.

## Tools

- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest, Cypress
- **Assertion Libraries**: Chai, Assert
- **Mocking Libraries**: Sinon, Nock, Mock Service Worker
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, TeamCity, GitLab CI
- **Monitoring Tools**: New Relic, DataDog, Sentry
- **Project Management**: TestRail, Jira

## Guidelines and Best Practices

- Back up production data before testing.
- Run tests during off-peak hours to reduce user impact.
- Ensure proper logging and monitoring to capture any issues.
- Use feature flags to enable/disable features during testing.
- Communicate testing schedules and potential impacts to stakeholders.

## Definition of Done

- All critical user flows have been tested and verified.
- No major issues or regressions have been identified.
- All detected issues have been documented and communicated.
- Monitoring and logging do not show new or unexplained errors.
