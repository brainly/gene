# API Testing Guide

## Why We Need API Tests

API tests are essential because they:

- Provide fast feedback on API functionality and reliability.
- Help identify issues early, reducing the cost of bug fixes.
- Ensure integration points between services are functioning as expected.
- Complement end-to-end (E2E) tests by covering scenarios difficult to test through the UI.

## Responsibilities

**Creation**

- **Developer**:
  - Creates tests when working on specific increments.
  - Fixes tests if they are flaky.
- **QA**:
  - Reviews and executes API tests.
  - Ensures test coverage and reliability.

**Fixing**

- The developer responsible for introducing the bug.

**Maintenance**

- The developer responsible for changes in the area covered by the API tests.

## Scope and Effort

- **Scope**: API tests should cover all critical endpoints, edge cases, and potential failure points.
- **Effort**: Estimation depends on the complexity of the APIs. Initial setup might require significant effort, but regular maintenance should be minimal.

## Tools

_Note: The team can decide which technology stack to use for E2E tests; the tools below are suggestions._

- **Cypress**: Known for ease of use, robust API testing capabilities, and CI/CD integration.
- **Postman**: Useful for manual API testing and creating automated tests.
- **Jest**: Can be combined with supertest for API testing.
- **Swagger**: Free tool for API testing and generating OpenAPI documentation.
- **Pact**: Ideal for contract testing between services.

## Guidelines and Best Practices

- Write clear, maintainable tests.
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order.
- Use descriptive names for test cases.
- Mock external dependencies to isolate the tested API endpoints, if necessary.

## Definition of Done

An API test is considered complete when it:

- Covers the defined scope and meets the acceptance criteria.
- Passes consistently in the test environment.
- Has been reviewed and approved by a peer.
- Is documented and added to the test suite.

## Examples

### Testing a GET Endpoint with Cypress

_Note: This example uses Cypress to test a GET endpoint. Other libraries, tools, or frameworks can be used based on specific requirements._

```js
describe('GET /api/users', () => {
  it('should return a list of users', () => {
    cy.request('GET', '/api/users').then((response) => {
      expect(response.status).to.eq(200);
      expect(response.body).to.have.length.greaterThan(0);
    });
  });
});
```
