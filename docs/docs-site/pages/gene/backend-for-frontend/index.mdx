title: Backend for Frontend (BFF) - core concept
---

# Core concept

The Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern is an architectural approach where a dedicated backend service is built specifically to serve a particular frontend application (e.g., mobile app, web app). BFFs help streamline the communication between frontend and backend, enabling tailored responses, optimized data handling, and simplified security for each client type. This approach can improve performance and user experience by reducing the amount of data transferred and simplifying API calls.

In our implementation, we use a Next.js application for creating the BFF because our development team is already familiar with the framework. Additionally, Next.js makes it easy to add API routes directly within the app, which simplifies backend development and reduces setup time.

**Note:** This section is a work in progress and will be expanded with more examples and use cases.
