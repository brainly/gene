# Intro to Gene ðŸ§¬

Gene is an opinionated React framework designed to bridge the gap between develpmpent speed project maintainability and scalability.

It highly leverages the power of **code generations** and **automation**. It is built on top of [Nx](https://nx.dev/concepts/mental-model) and [Nx Workspace Generators](https://nx.dev/packages/workspace/documents/overview).

## Mental Model

Gene's mental model and architecture on the highest level is the following:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'dark'}}%%
graph TD
    app[example-app] --> module1[example-module-1]:::module
    app --> module2[example-module-2]:::module
    module1 --> lib1[example-ui-library-1]:::lib
    module1 --> lib2[example-ui-library-2]:::lib
    lib2 --> component1[example-ui-component-1]:::component
    lib2 --> component2[example-ui-component-2]:::component

    style app fill:#61fef8,stroke:#defffe,stroke-width:2px,color:black
    classDef module fill:#9ffffb,stroke:#c9fffd,stroke-width:2px,color:black
    classDef lib fill:#c9fffd,stroke:#9ffffb,stroke-width:2px,color:black
    classDef component fill:#defffe,stroke:#61fef8,stroke-width:2px,color:black
```

- An `app` is built up of one or many `modules`.
- A `module` consists of `components`, that are (usually) imported from `ui-libraries`.
  - One module can use as many ui-libraries as many it requires.
  - Modules can have their own components too if they are not shared and are 100% module specific.

`Gene Modules` are **standalone pieces of UI elements**, they have no dependency between each other.
Though, they can communicate with each other, but more on that later.

Important to mention: gene modules are
framework agnostic thanks to âœ¨_Dependency Injection_âœ¨ (that we will talk about in the following chapters),
thus they can be used in NextJS or pure React or any other react framework if we wanted to do so.

**Let's see a "live" example!**

Through this example we will try to show how does a React application import modules and builds itself up.

_We have our beautiful UI:_

<EnlargableContent>
  <Image
    src="/get-started/my-app-base.png"
    width={901}
    height={621}
    alt="My app"
  />
</EnlargableContent>

If we dissect the application we can see that it is built up of Gene Modules that are built up of Components:

<EnlargableContent>
  <Image
    src="/get-started/my-app-dissected.png"
    width={1281}
    height={731}
    alt="My app"
  />
</EnlargableContent>

_Please notice that the background colors of the comments on the UI diagram
correspond with the blocks on our first diagram with the high level architecture_

On the diagram we mentioned NextJS but it can really be any React framework,
although currently **_we base our applications exclusively on NextJS._**

## Get Started

<Steps>
### Create new Gene workspace

```sh filename="Create a new Gene workspace named 'acme'" copy
npm init @brainly-gene acme
```

### Go to the created workspace

```sh copy
cd acme
```

### Open the workspace in your favorite code editor, e.g. VSCode

```sh copy
code .
```

### Generate a new Next.js app

```sh copy
pnpm nx g @brainly-gene/tools:nextjs-app --name my-first-app --directory web --no-interactive 
```

### Run the app ðŸ¥³

```sh copy
pnpm nx serve my-first-app
```
