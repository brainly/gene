# Create Component

### Prerequisites

**Important**: Components can only be generated within _component libraries_.

The target library for your new component must be created with the [components-library-generator](https://github.com/brainly/gene/blob/master/packages/gene-tools/src/generators/components-library-generator/README.md). If the library does not exist, you can generate a new one with the following command:

```shell
npx nx g @brainly/gene-tools:components-library
```

### Creating a Component

To create a component, use the NX plugin's [component-generator](https://github.com/brainly/gene/blob/master/packages/gene-tools/src/generators/component-generator/README.md) or run the following command in the CLI:

```shell
npx nx g @brainly/gene-tools:component --library=my-components-ui
```

**Generator Options:**

- `prompts-profile`: Choose between `basic`, `simple`, or `advanced`.
- `library`: Specify the library where the component should be placed.

After generation, the components will appear in the designated location with the following structure:

```
repo-dir
│   README.md
│   package.json
│   ...
└───libs
    └───my-components-ui
        │   .storybook
        │   ...
        └───src
            └───HelloWorld
                │   index.ts
                │   HelloWorld.tsx
                │   HelloWorld.module.scss
                │   HelloWorld.spec.tsx
                │   HelloWorld.stories.tsx
```

The generator automatically handles the component boilerplate, Storybook files, SCSS, basic specs, and re-exports.

Now, you can run Storybook in the component library to view the generated component and start development:

```shell
npx nx run my-components-ui:storybook
```
