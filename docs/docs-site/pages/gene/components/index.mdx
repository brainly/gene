# Core Concept

Gene components operate on key principles that enable efficient use of the framework's full capabilities. A clear understanding of the separation between application-layer concerns and component concerns is essential.

- **Components are fully decoupled.**
- **Components communicate with the application only through dispatched events.**
- **The application communicates with components only through props.**

This approach ensures each component remains standalone and free of application-specific dependencies. Gene's reliance on events for application communication effectively addresses issues like callback hell and props drilling.

The following diagram illustrates this structure:
