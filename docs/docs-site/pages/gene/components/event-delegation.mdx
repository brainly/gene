# Event Delegation and Mediation

All components in the Gene framework dispatch events for handling by application-level mediators. To facilitate this, we use **event delegation**, where all mediated component events must be both **bubbling** and **cancelable**. 

## Example

Consider a basic `Button` component:

```jsx
export function MyButton({ text }) {
  return <button onClick={() => {}}>{text}</button>
}
```

Typically, you might handle a click event by passing a custom `onClick` prop with a callback. However, in Gene, you should instead dispatch the click event with both `cancelable` and `bubbles` set to `true`. The application mediator will then capture and cancel the event. 

> **Important:** Mediators always cancel delegated events to prevent unintended cross-event interactions.

This approach helps avoid prop drilling between nested components and keeps application logic and dependencies out of reusable components.

## Dispatching Events in Gene

Gene provides a `dispatch` method to handle proper event delegation:

```jsx
import { dispatch } from '@brainly/gene'

export function MyButton({ text }) {
  const handleClick = React.useCallback((e) => {
    dispatch(e.target, ['onMyButtonClicked']);
  }, []);

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{text}</button>
}
```

With this setup, the `onMyButtonClicked` event is dispatched on a button click. You can handle this event using the native `element.addEventListener('onMyButtonClicked')` method. However, in React, you'll need to remember to remove listeners on component unmounting and to stop propagation according to the event delegation pattern.

## Using `useMediator` in Gene

To simplify event handling, Gene provides a `useMediator` hook, which manages event handling and cleanup in React.

### Example Usage

```jsx
import { useMediator } from '@brainly/gene'
import { useRef } from 'react'

function MyApp() {
  const ref = useRef()

  useMediator(
    'onMyButtonClicked',
    () => console.log('button clicked!'),
    ref
  );

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      My App Layout...
      <MyButton text="Click me!" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, `useMediator` listens for the `onMyButtonClicked` event within the specified `ref` context and logs a message when the button is clicked. This hook handles setup and teardown of listeners automatically, ensuring a consistent event delegation pattern and easing the development experience in React.
