# Gene Services

## Motivation

We built abstracted services to provide a unified API, allowing users to interact with services without needing to know the specific client in use. Only the service author handles client specifics. For more information, you can [read the article on our service architecture](https://medium.com/brainly/ultimate-react-service-hook-architecture-519b752d8478).

## Common API

Each of our services returns a common API format:
```jsx
const { data, loading, error, fetchMore, refetch } = useMyService();
```

## Supported Clients

Currently, we support two clients:
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)

## Server-Side Hydration

Gene services are designed for server-side hydration. Although they function on the client side, their primary purpose is to hydrate services with data gathered on the server.

### Query Clients Concept

In Next.js applications, developers use the `getServerSideProps` pattern to hydrate views with server-side data by passing props to the page, as described in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props#using-getserversideprops-to-fetch-data-at-request-time).

However, React's nested component structure can lead to complex prop drilling. Although using a `context` to pass `serverProps` can reduce this complexity, it does not solve the issue entirely, particularly regarding cache invalidation. This setup results in two data sources: the props and the client-side instance of the query client, complicating cache management.

Our solution is to create a QueryClient instance on the server, fetch data, populate the QueryClient state, and send this state to the client side via the `serverProps` pattern. On the client side, we then initialize a QueryClient instance with the server-prepared initial state. This approach provides the following benefits:
- A single source of data
- QueryClient manages cache state and handles invalidation
