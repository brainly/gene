# Contexts

To communicate between modules Gene uses two patterns, one is AppContext - where we keep common state,
and another is [Event Bus](/gene/eventBus), which allows us for event based communication.

The app context communication bases on app state changes. As the state may be used by many modules, when it changes,
the context is updated and all modules that are using this context are re-rendered.

## What is app context for?
- holding common state that is used by multiple modules
- holding dynamic data that cannot be fetched from API (e.g. user settings) and needs to be shared between modules
- communication between modules (via some state property)

## What is app context **not** for?
- holding raw or transformed data fetched from API with the intention of being shared between modules
(in this case each module should call the service and transform the data on its own)
- holding _feature flag_-like data
- holding data that cannot be easily serialized/deserialized (e.g. functions)


If you want to use context in your module we are recommending usage of `makeStore` pattern by creating contexts with `makeStore` helper.
Example context:

```tsx
import {makeStore} from '@brainly/gene';

export enum Actions {
  UPDATE_HELLO,
  RESET_HELLO,
}

type StateType = {
  hello: string;
};

type ActionType = {
  type: Actions;
  value: string;
};

const initialState = {
  hello: 'world',
};

function reducer(state: StateType, action: ActionType) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case Actions.UPDATE_HELLO:
      return {
        ...state,
        hello: action.value,
      };
    case Actions.RESET_HELLO:
      return {
        ...state,
        hello: 'world',
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const [StoreProvider, useDispatch, useStore] = makeStore<StateType, ActionType>(
  initialState,
  reducer
);

export {StoreProvider, useStore, useDispatch};
```

## Add context provider

To be able to use context on module level, you need to wrap your module with provider. To do that you can use module manifest file and define
all providers for modules:

```jsx
import {createGeneModule} from '@brainly/gene';
import {StoreProvider, AnotherStoreProvider} from './contexts';
import {MyModule as RawMyModule} from './MyModule';

const {declarations, module: MyModule} = createGeneModule({
  module: RawMyModule,
  declarations: {
    contextProviders: [StoreProvider, AnotherStoreProvider],
  },
});

export {MyModule, declarations};
```

with that you will be able to use context on module level, i.e:

```jsx
function MyModule() {
  const store = useStore()
  const anotherStore = useAnotherStore()
  ...
  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

Contexts will be rendered in the same order as in definition, so if definiton is:

```jsx
contextProviders: [StoreProvider, AnotherStoreProvider];
```

then contexts will be render:

```jsx
<StoreProvider>
  <AnotherStoreProvider>
    <MyModule />
  </AnotherStoreProvider>
</StoreProvider>
```
