# StorybookProviders

`StorybookProviders` provides commonly used containers for many modules, including:

- Service clients
- Router
- Translation
- Tracking
- App context

## Generating StorybookProviders

To use `StorybookProviders`, generate it with the following `nx` command:

```bash
nx g @brainly/gene-tools:e2e-providers
```

Then import it in your Storybook file:

```tsx
import { StorybookProviders } from '@acme/e2e-testing-providers';
```

You do not need to create these containers individually, but you can pass specific options to customize some of them. The available options for `StorybookProviders` include:

## Available Options

### `routingOptions`

This option allows you to modify routing properties, such as changing the current question for a module.

```jsx
<StorybookProviders
  routingOptions={{
    query: {
      id: '680975',
    },
  }}
></StorybookProviders>
```

### `initialAppContext`

The app context container includes default state values located in `libs/e2e-testing-providers/src/lib/ioc/contextContainer.ts`. To add or override values in the app state, pass an object with the desired values.

```jsx
<StorybookProviders
  initialAppContext={{
    dateFormat: 'd/m/Y',
  }}
></StorybookProviders>
```

### `appContextReducer`

To modify state logic in response to actions, you can create and pass a custom reducer. Define your reducer first:

```jsx
const someReducer = (state: AppStoreType, action: ActionType) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'myAction': {
      return {
        ...state,
        myValue: state.myValue + 1,
      };
    }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

Then, pass the reducer as a prop:

```jsx
<StorybookProviders appContextReducer={someReducer}></StorybookProviders>
```

Use these options to tailor `StorybookProviders` for your specific Storybook needs.
