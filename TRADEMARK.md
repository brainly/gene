# Brainly Gene \- Trademark Guidelines

Version 1.0 dated Oct. 22, 2024

This trademark policy was prepared to help you understand how to use Brainly trademarks, service marks and logos with the Brainly Gene software.

**While some of our software is available under a free and open source software license, that copyright license does not include a license to use our trademark**, **and this Policy is intended to explain how to use our marks consistent with background law and community expectation.**

This policy covers our trademarks and service marks “Brainly Gene” and “Gene.”

This policy encompasses all trademarks and service marks, whether they are registered or not.

## 1. GENERAL GUIDELINES

* Whenever you use one of our marks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone about what they are getting and from whom. For example, you cannot say you are distributing the Brainly Gene software when you’re distributing a modified version of it, because recipients may not understand the differences between your modified versions and our own.

* You also cannot use our logo on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official website or that we endorse your website. You may not use or register our marks, or variations of them as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name.

* You can, though, say you like the Brainly Gene software, that you participate in the Brainly Gene community, that you are providing an unmodified version of the Brainly Gene software.

* Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to ours. You therefore may not use an obvious variation of any of our marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service.

* You are not authorized to use the Brainly marks or logos to convey or imply an endorsement by or partnership with Brainly without Brainly’s prior written approval.

## 2. ACCEPTABLE USES

### Unmodified code

When you redistribute an unmodified copy of our software \-- the exact form in which we make it available \-- you must **retain** the marks we have placed on the software to identify your redistribution.

### Modified code

If you distribute a modified version of our software, you must **remove** all of our logos from it. To assist you with this, we have removed our logos from our source trees, and include them only in our binaries.You may use our word marks, but not our logos, to truthfully describe the origin of the software that you are providing.

For example, if the code you are distributing is a modification of our software, you may say, “*This software is derived from the source code for Brainly Gene software*.”

### Statements about compatibility

You may use the word marks and Brainly Gene logo s to truthfully describe the relationship between your software and ours. If you wish to use our other logos, please contact us to discuss license terms.

### Naming Compatible Products

If you wish to describe your product with reference to the Brainly Gene software, here are the conditions under which you may do so. You may call your software “XYZ” (where “XYZ” is your product name) for Brainly Gene only if:

* All versions of the Brainly Gene software you deliver with your product are the exact binaries provided by us.

* Your product is fully compatible with the APIs for the Brainly Gene software described at <https://github.com/brainly/gene>.

* You use the following legend in marketing materials or product descriptions: “Brainly is a trademark of Brainly sp. z o.o. <https://github.com/brainly/gene”>

### No Domain Names

You must not register any domain that includes our word marks or any variant or combination of them.

## **3. HOW TO DISPLAY OUR MARKS**

When you have the right to use our mark, here is how to display it.

### Trademark marking and legends

Place the following notice at the foot of the page where you have used the mark: “*Brainly is trademark of Brainly sp. z o.o.*”

### Use of trademarks in text

Always use trademarks in their exact form with the correct spelling, neither abbreviated, hyphenated, or combined with any other word or words.

Don’t pluralize a trademark.

Always use a trademark as an adjective modifying a noun.

### Use of Logos

You may not change any logo except to scale it. This means you may not add decorative elements, change the colors, change the proportions, distort it, add elements, or combine it with other logos.

However, when the context requires the use of black-and-white graphics and the logo is color, you may reproduce the logo in a manner that produces a black-and-white image.
